# Estimating the five fairness premiums {#sec-training}

:::{.callout-note}

## Objectives

Building on the simulations in @sec-simul-dataset, this section estimates the spectrum of fairness. It complements Section 4.2 of the **main paper**, linked from the supplementâ€™s introduction. We recommend keeping the main paper nearby, as this supplement focuses exclusively on implementation.

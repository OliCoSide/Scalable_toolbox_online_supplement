# Example setup and simulations {#sec-simul-dataset}

:::{.callout-note}

## Objectives

This section introduces the setup of a simulated example with three scenarios. We compute theoretical values for the five premium benchmarks, visualize them to aid interpretation, and simulate data for use in subsequent sections.

This material complements Section 4.1 of the **main paper**, linked from the supplementâ€™s introduction.
